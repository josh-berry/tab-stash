        Sorry to hear you're having trouble, and thanks for taking the time to report a crash!

        If you're not sure whether you have one problem or multiple problems, it's better to err on the side of opening separate reports for each potential problem, since it's much easier to close duplicates than split a single issue into multiple issues.

        If you tried anything to work around or recover from the bug, or if the bug caused additional problems, discuss it here.  Be as concrete, specific and detailed as possible.

        For example, "I spent an hour trying to restart the encabulator to retrieve my data after the crash" clearly illustrates the scale and scope of the problem.  Whereas, "This is a huge problem and should be fixed ASAP" is likely to be ignored because it doesn't provide any detail about WHY the problem is huge.
