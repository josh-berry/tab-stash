        Thanks for taking the time to suggest an improvement to Tab Stash!

        To keep things organized, please put only ONE feature per request.  If you're not sure whether your idea would be one or multiple feature requests, it's better to err on the side of opening separate requests, since it's much easier to close duplicates than split a single request into multiple requests.

        What problem are you trying to solve that this feature could help with?  Why is this feature important to you?  Be as concrete, specific and detailed as possible.

        For example, "I have over 1,000,000 tabs stashed across 100,000 groups, and I can never find anything because scrolling takes a long time" clearly illustrates the scale and scope of the problem.  Whereas, "Missing search feature is a huge problem" is likely to be ignored because it doesn't provide any detail about WHY the lack of a search feature is a huge problem.
